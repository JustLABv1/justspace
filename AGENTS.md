- document all changes to the database (appwrite) in the APPWRITE_SCHEMA.md
- always ensure that all changes or new files are free of problems or errors
- the `cat` command is an alias and behind it is the `bat` cli tool.
- Dont use `cat` command to replace content in files. Behind the `cat` command is an alias for `bat` and that works different than `cat`
